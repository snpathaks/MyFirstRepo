_ARRAY_:-
Theroy questions:
Q1. what is an Array ?
Ans: An array is a linear data structure that stores multiple elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations.
Q2. What is the time complexity and space complexity of an array?
Ans: For accessing an element (by index):
     Time Complexity: O(1)        Space Complexity: O(1)
     For searching(unsorted array by linear search):
     Time complexity: O(n)        Space Complexity: O(1)
     For searching(sorted array by binary search):
     Time complexity: O(logn)     Space Complexity: O(1)
     For Traversal :
     Time complexity: O(n)        Space complexity: O(1)
     For Insertion at the end:
     Time complexity: O(1)        Space complexity: O(1)
     For insertion at the begining:
     Time complexity: O(n)        Space complexity: O(n)
     For deletiion :
     Time complexity: O(n)        Space complexity: O(1)
